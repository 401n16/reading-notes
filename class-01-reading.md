# CLASS 01 READING DISCUSSION
## Node Ecosystem, TDD, CI/CD

#### 1. Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?
    - Running JavaScript outside of a browser allows you to do more than simple websites, such as:
      - adding a database
      - an API
      - events
      - triggers
      - a phone app
      - and more
#### 2. What is the difference between a module and a package?
    - They are both Node.js concepts:
      - Modules are pieces of JavaScript code that are meant to be called in another file or chunk of code
      - Packages are extensions of modules (??)
#### 3. What is one benefit of Test Driven Development?
    - TDD can help prevent uncertainty during the development process. It only allows code to be added to the code base after it has been proven to meet the requirements.
#### 4. What is one potential downside of Test Driven Development?
    - TDD is not sufficient for testing where the determination of success or failure is dependent upon the software being fully functional.
#### 5. What does the node package manager do?
    - The node package manager allows developers to use packages created and shared by independent devleopors.
