# Article 1 - How to Solve Programming Problems

### A simple set of steps to follow for any algorithm type programming problem
1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
    - It is very important to solve the problem manually first, so that you know what you are going to automate, otherwise you are just slinging code around. 
    - Don’t forget to look for corner cases and edge cases and do any examples for those kind of cases you can think of.
    - Recognize what your brain is actually doing to solve the problem. Write down each little step.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
    - It is much easier to rearrange and reconstruct and idea or algorithm in your head than it is in code.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
    - Outline the structure of the code you will write to solve the problem.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
    - If you struggle here, there are usually two possible reasons:
      1. You didn’t break down the problem into small enough steps
      2. You don’t know your programming language well enough to do the conversion
6. Optimize the real code.

*As much as 70% of your time should be spent in steps 1-3.*
